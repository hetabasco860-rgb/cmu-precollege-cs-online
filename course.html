      <h2>Course Format</h2>
      <p>
        The program is delivered fully online across <strong>20 structured sessions</strong>.
        Instruction emphasizes conceptual foundations, programming practice, and
        project-oriented skill development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Students progress through guided instruction, applied exercises, and
        milestone check-ins designed to support consistent improvement over the
        duration of the program.

      <h2>Curriculum Outline</h2>
      <p>
        The curriculum spans the AP CS foundations and extends into advanced topics.
        Specific emphasis areas may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming fundamentals and program design</li>
        <li>Data structures and algorithmic problem solving</li>
        <li>Computing systems, data, networks, and societal impacts</li>
        <li>Advanced topics beyond the AP curriculum (selected based on cohort readiness)</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Certificate Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Students who successfully complete the program and submit the
        <strong>Final Project</strong> will receive a Certificate of Completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Final Project is evaluated from a <strong>single official submission</strong>.
        Expectations, sample project directions, and evaluation criteria are provided on the
